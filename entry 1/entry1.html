In an age dominated by digital technology, Orion's work stands out for its ability to infuse a timeless quality into his subjects, allowing their true essence to shine through. I had the incredible opportunity to meet Orion at his debut photography exhibition, where his artistry and genuine passion for his craft were on full display. What made the experience even more special was when i got to take portraits of him and capture his essence, just as he does with his subjects in front of a camera.";
